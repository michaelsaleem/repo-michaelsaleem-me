### About [ aboutSection ]
about:
  enable: true
  title: "About Me"
  subtitle: "My Story"
  text: "<p>Before working in Information Technology, I worked in consumer retail for 8 years. It was here where I learned the importance of customer service. I used to sell digital SLR cameras, and I remember having to provide product demonstrations while explaining all the technical jargon (aperture, shutter speed, ISO etc) in layman's terms.</p>
  
  <p>In 2013, I then started my first job in the IT industry working in a Data Centre as an Operations Technician (DCOPS). I think it's fair to say that the amount of technical jargon that I was exposed to exponentially increased compared to when I was working in the retail sector; but, I absolutely loved it! Building and racking servers, cabling and performing a basic level of troubleshooting was actually really enjoyable</p>

  <p>Still working in the same company at that point, I then progressed into different roles such as 2nd Line Support Analyst and then moved into a Network Security Engineer / Architect role. I predominantly specialise in load balancers such as the F5 BIG-IP and firewalls such as Palo Alto NGFW and Cisco Firepower.</p>
  
  <p>That brings me to where I am today (with a wife and a couple of kids thrown into the mix for good measure 😆). Nowadays, I try to continously learn technologies every day - such as cloud, cyber security and automation.</p>

  <p>I am a huge believer in knowledge sharing; I do my best to impart any knowledge that I have with others. I am a regular contributor to the F5 DevCentral community, where I am currently an <a href='https://community.f5.com/kb/devcentralnews/2024-devcentral-mvp-announcement/326017' target='_blank'>MVP</a>.</p>"
